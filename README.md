### ðŸ”¸ Banking App (`app/`)
- User login with predefined accounts:
  - `js` (PIN: `1111`)
  - `sd` (PIN: `2222`)
  - `mv` (PIN: `3333`)
  - `sg` (PIN: `4444`)
- View all transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
- Transfer money to another user by entering their username.
- Request a loan (only if the user has at least one deposit of 10% or more of the requested amount).
- Close (delete) an account.
- Dynamic calculation of account balance, total deposits, withdrawals, and interest.
- Transaction sorting functionality.
- Currently front-end only â€“ all accounts are hardcoded in the app.

## ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Connect the landing page and banking app to a real backend with database and authentication.
- Enable actual account creation and user authentication.
- Further improve the design and optimize UX/UI.
